Predicate logic
Propositional logic: “and, or, not” and variables.
Propositional logic does not have quantifiers:
“All poodles are dogs.”
“There is at least one black swan.”
“Only supervisors are allowed to fill in the form.”
“No person can solve this problem.”
These sentences cannot be expressed in propositional logic.

Quantifiers: all, at least one
First order logic: quantifiers for individuals.
“All squirrels eat nuts.”
Second order logic: quantifiers for predicates.
S = “squirrels eat nuts”
“All S involves chewing.”

Syntax and semantics
Predicate logic is a formal language (like a programming language)
with rules for
syntax (i.e. how to write expressions) and
semantics (i.e. how to formalise the meaning of expressions).

Syntax: well-formed formulas
I logical symbols: and, or, not, all, at least one, brackets,
variables, equality (=), true, false
I predicate and function symbols
(for example, Cat(x) for “x is a Cat”)
I term: variables and functions
(for example, Cat(x))
I formula: any combination of terms and logical symbols
(for example, “Cat(x) and Sleeps(x)”)
I sentence: formulas without free variables
(for example, “All x: Cat(x) and Sleeps(x)”)
