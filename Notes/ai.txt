Intelligence Artificial Intelligence Goals/Objective of Ai Conventional and Intelligent Computing   Advantages and Disadvantages Of Ai   Application of Ai The ability of a human being to acquire knowledge and apply it, means the capability of thinking and reasoning. According to the Henri Bergson:  intelligence is the facility of making artificial objects.     The attribute and ability of a person through which a problem can be solved accurately.
There are different definition of Ai     A man made device that reflect one or more characteristics of human being is called Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence is a subfield of Computer science devoted to making computer software and Hardware that imitates the human minds.
It is a set of methods and techniques to develop such a computer system that shows intelligent behavior. Artificial Intelligence is a special branch of computer science or set of techniques and approaches to solve those problems that normally requires human intelligence.
Artificial Intelligence is the art of creating machines that perform functions that require intelligence when performed by people. Artificial intelligence is attempt to create computer programs that do intelligent things.
Human solve problem through intelligence or common sense. 1. Suppose two person A and B both are playing chess.   A Chess B  tries his best to play such a move of class so that he can defeat B and similarly B also tries to do so. Now if we replace B with such computer that can play chess.
A Chess Computer if that computer has a software which work like an expert player that software will posses the artificial intelligence.
2. if a computer has a software that can converts data written in English into some other language like French etc. this prove that, that software passes Ai. English S/w having Ai French
The main goals of Ai are:   To make computer smarter by creating s/w that will allow a computer to mimic/adopt some of the function of the human brain in selected application; that is to provide us a more powerful tool to assist us in our work.
Simply the goal of Artificial intelligence is to develop such a program by which computer can take decision itself like human beings.       To investigate the nature of a human intelligence. To model process underlying intelligence. To provide useful programs.
There are some advantages of Ai:     User will be able to Communicate with Computers in their own language. English or any other language rather than having to use the cryptic commands and syntax of operating system languages and application programs. With artificial intelligence an untrained user can approach the machine and achieve useful work.
 Artificial intelligence as used in expert system have the potential to make problem solving and decision making a specific domain faster and easier. It can be more useful by solving a wider range of problems.   Less errors and defect.   Can complete task faster than a human can likely.
 Artificial Intelligence application usually requires very powerful computers with fast CPU and lots of memory. Most Ai Research and many AI applications are implemented on mainframes and mini Computers. Such as digital equipment's corporations (DEC) AX series. Typical system sell from $150000 to nearly a half million of dollars.
 Another disadvantages of is the difficulty of Ai S/w and development of Ai program incredibly complex. High cost, because it require a wide range of H/w and S/w.
 Conventional Computers:   The Computer by which we can develop computer programs using conventional languages like C, C++, Cobol etc. are called conventional computers and the software which is used for that purpose is called conventional software.
 Intelligent Computer:           Those computer which are used for processing the Artificial intelligence software using Artificial intelligence languages like Lisp(List processing). PRLOG(programming in Logic) etc. are called intelligent computers. These are used for: Language Translate System Robotic System Air Travel speech Processing Expert System.
 In conventional software we tell the computer; how to solve the problems, whereas in Artificial intelligent we tell the computer what the problem is but not how to solve it. Conventional Computer programs are based on an algorithm; a clearly defined step by step procedure for solving a problem. It may be a mathematical formula or a clearly defined sequential procedure that will lead to a solution.
 in conventional Computing; we normally solve quantitative problems; which used algorithm. In Ai computing; we solve qualitative problem which is not solvable by algorithm. One of the facility provided by conventional software system is Doing repetitive and laborious jobs. e.g; An organization requires to store the records of 1000 employees. So for this situation conventional computer system provided loop statements which provide much facility and a lot of time.
 The major application area of Ai are:   Natural Language processing   Robotics   Expert System   Computer Vision
